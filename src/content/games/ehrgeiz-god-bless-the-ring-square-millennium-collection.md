I used to own the PAL version as a kid, but I ended up selling it... I wish I could get it back, but it's so expensive now. Thankfully, I managed to find that amazing edition at Super Potato in 2016 for a decent price.
Let’s be honest, the game isn’t that great. I only bought it because you can play as FF7 characters.
