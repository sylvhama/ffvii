My older brother introduced me to Final Fantasy VII back in 1997. I remember creating my own save and naming Cloud _Mario_ and Barret _Luigi_. When I got older, I bought each disc for 1 euro so I could replay the game. During college, I found a damaged but complete version. I never would have imagined how big my collection would grow! nor all the places Iâ€™d discover thanks to that game.
