I found the first edition while visiting Seoul in a store similar to BOOKOFF back in 2013. It covers the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII.
I got the revised edition (which includes new pages) in 2024 while visiting Tokyo. I was able to order it via Amazon JP and have it delivered to a Family Mart right next to my hotel!
I enjoy seeing artwork from games that were never released in the West, as well as the connections between the different characters.
