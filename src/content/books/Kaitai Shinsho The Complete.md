These are guidebooks published by Famitsu. There is the original version and a revised edition (改訂版, Kaiteiban) which covers Final Fantasy VII International. I found them in BOOKOFF shops while traveling in Japan.
Their small format and subtle background illustrations made them difficult to notice among other books.
