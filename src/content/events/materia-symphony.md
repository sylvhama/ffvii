This concert had been delayed several times because of COVID. It was finally performed by the OJV (Orchestre de Jeux Vidéo) at the Église St-Jean-Baptiste in Montreal in November 2022. The first part of the show explored the franchise’s origins. In the second half, the orchestra and a 100-voice choir will performed Materia Symphony, a new work inspired by Final Fantasy VII.
