This concert had been delayed several times because of COVID. It was finally performed by the OJV (Orchestre de Jeux Vidéo) at the Église St-Jean-Baptiste in Montreal in November 2022. The show began with the origins of the franchise and ended with Materia Symphony, performed by an orchestra and 100-voice choir.
