When visiting Tokyo in May 2014, I realized that the Final Symphony concert would take place at the Tokyo Metropolitan Festival Hall. Since I was planning to visit Ueno Park, I decided to see if I could get a last-minute ticket. Sadly, it was sold out, so I went out and sat on a bench to think about where I should go next. Then the staff I had just talked to ran up to me and said that someone was trying to resell their ticket! So I bought it, and the concert was amazing! I even got the chance to meet Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu after the show!
A year later, I also attended the Final Symphony II concert in Yokohama. This time, I bought my ticket in advance!
