I never lived in Paris, but I could not miss the very first Distant Worlds concert in France in January 2013. I also wanted to experience a more epic concert compared to the intimate Nobuo Uematsu concert from the year before. And I was not disappointed at all! Except for one thing: we did not have assigned seats. I was able to secure one in the front rows, but security asked us to move, and I ended up in the back!
