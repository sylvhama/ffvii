Nobuo Uematsuâ€™s first band was called The Black Mages; then he formed the Earthbound Papas. This concert was not an official Earthbound Papas concert since there were only three members: Nobuo Uematsu (keys), Yoshitaka Hirota (bass), and Tsutomu Narita (keys). But the concert, which took place in November 2012, was still great and more intimate.
